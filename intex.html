<H1>Welcome to the Taj Mahal</H1>
<p>The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.
    <br>It is widely recognized as "the jewel of Muslim art in India" and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.
    <br>Constructed in 1632 and completed in 1648, the Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US$1 billion).
    <br> The Taj Mahal is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
    <br> The Taj Mahal is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture   and a symbol of India's rich history.
    <br> The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year, making it one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world.
    <br> It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".
